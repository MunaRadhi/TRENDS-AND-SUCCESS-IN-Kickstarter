# TRENDS-AND-SUCCESS-IN-Kickstarter
An Analysis of Kickstarter Projects Types and Trends
## Tools 
- **Python** 


## Problem Statement
Kickstarter hosts diverse project types with varying outcomes, yet it is unclear why some categories achieve high success rates while others consistently struggle. There is limited understanding of which project types attract faster funding growth, which generate higher contributions per backer, and how seasonality influences performance. Without these insights, creators may set unrealistic goals or launch at suboptimal times, reducing their chances of success.

## Goals
- Find most & least successful project types.  
- Highlight funding growth across categories.  
- Identify risky categories.  
- Spot top-contributing types (average pledge per backer).  
- Understand seasonal effects on project success.  

## Key Insights & Recommendations

### Success by Category
- **Top performers:** Dance (74.6%), Theater (70.7%), Music (67.5%)  
- **Lowest performers:** Fashion (32.9%), Technology (39.3%), Publishing (40.2%)  
- **Insight:** Creative projects with clear goals tend to succeed more than product-based projects with complex logistics.  
- **Recommendation:** Recognize the strengths and challenges of your category. If it’s a high-success one, keep your project focused and authentic to what backers already value. If it’s a lower-success one, anticipate barriers like cost, logistics, or trust, and counter them with strong prototypes, transparent communication, and realistic funding goals.  

### Popularity vs. Success
- **Most backers:** Film & Video, Music, Games  
- **Insight:** Large audience doesn’t guarantee success. Categories like Dance have smaller but highly committed audiences that consistently support projects.  
- **Recommendation:** Don’t rely only on a large audience. Prioritize uniqueness and creativity that spark passion. Building a loyal, engaged community—even if smaller—can lead to higher funding success than chasing sheer numbers.  

### Risk Assessment
- **High-risk categories:** Fashion, Technology  
- **Insight:** Physical products involve higher costs and delivery challenges.  
- **Recommendation:** In high-risk categories like Fashion and Technology, keep funding goals modest and prove deliverability. Clear plans and realistic expectations increase backer confidence.  

### Top-Contributing Categories
- **Insight:** Some categories attract backers who contribute more per person, showing the presence of a committed audience. Projects in these categories can achieve success through strong engagement rather than sheer number of backers.  
- **Recommendation:** Focus on cultivating depth of engagement. Highlight your project’s uniqueness, story, and long-term value so backers feel invested enough to pledge higher amounts, even if the supporter base is smaller.  

### Seasonal and Timing Effects (Future Analysis)
- **Insight:** Optimal launch periods could improve funding success. Certain categories may perform better at specific times of year (e.g., Games/Tech before holidays, Art in spring).  
- **Recommendation:** Plan your launch strategically. Align with seasonal interest peaks and external events. For example, launching a game before holiday season or a food/art project in spring could boost visibility and backer enthusiasm.
